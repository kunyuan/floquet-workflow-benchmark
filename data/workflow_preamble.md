# Workflow context (common to every task in this suite)

You are solving an instance of the **Floquet effective Hamiltonian derivation
and analysis** workflow. Problems of this class are solved by the following
pipeline:

1. **Define the time-periodic Hamiltonian** — specify the system and driving
   parameters to obtain H(t) with period T = 2π/ω.
2. **Choose a Floquet approach** — select the appropriate method (exact
   diagonalization of the Floquet matrix, one-period evolution operator,
   high-frequency expansion, degenerate perturbation theory) based on the
   driving frequency and amplitude regime.
3. **Construct the effective Floquet Hamiltonian or Floquet matrix** — obtain
   a time-independent representation generating the stroboscopic dynamics.
4. **Compute quasienergies and Floquet states** — obtain the quasienergy
   spectrum and the corresponding Floquet states.
5. **Evaluate observables and dynamics** — use the Floquet states to compute
   the requested time-averaged or stroboscopic quantities (gaps, invariants,
   critical parameters, effective couplings, …).

Sanity-check your results against exact numerical Floquet evolution for small
systems where feasible, and check convergence with truncation and time-step
parameters.

The task below is one concrete problem from this family. Apply the workflow;
the specific system, parameters, conventions, and requested outputs follow.
