# Environment & answer protocol (common to every task in this suite)

- Compute environment: Python 3 with numpy and scipy available. No internet
  access is required or assumed; everything needed is stated in the task.
- Work in the task directory. You may write any scratch files you need.
- **Answer emission**: write your final answer to `pred.json` in the task
  directory — a single JSON object whose keys are exactly the quantity ids
  requested in the task text (no extra keys). Numeric values as JSON numbers;
  formula-type answers as expression strings using only the symbols the task
  declares.
- Report numeric values to at least 6 significant digits unless the task
  states a different precision.
- Convergence is your responsibility: where a calculation involves
  truncation, grid, or time-step choices, converge them until your answer is
  stable at the reported precision.
- **Derivation log (required)**: alongside `pred.json`, write
  `derivation.md` — a detailed step-by-step account of your solution,
  organized by the workflow steps above (1. model setup → 2. method choice
  and why → 3. construction → 4. spectrum → 5. observables). Show the
  actual derivation: intermediate expressions, the equations you solved,
  numerical convergence checks, and how each requested quantity was
  obtained. State explicitly where you made approximations and why they are
  valid in this regime. This log is not scored against the gold but is
  collected with your answer.
